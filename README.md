# Lumi

Minimalistic Sublime Text colour scheme with constant luminance

![Screenshot](ruby_example.png)

## Motivation

My aim here was to create a super-minimalistic, light Sublime Text colour scheme
that keeps colour variations to the minimum and tries to maintain constant
luminance. I've grown a litle bit tired of flashy colours in the code and found
myself moving towards colour schemes with minimal syntax highlighting.
One example of such a theme is
[Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster)
which I have based this on

## Installation

I'll be submitting Lumi to Package Control soon. For now it can be installed by
manually copying `Lumi.sublime-color-scheme` into the Sublime Text's package
directory
